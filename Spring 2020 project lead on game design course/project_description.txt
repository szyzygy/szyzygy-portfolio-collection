in this project I lead a team of 3 other students in our course on the study of game design. 
working together we built a basic top down shooter game and I assisted each member in both 
art direction and code design. I also contributed a large amount of unity knowledge to the project.
in this folder are the C# files I wrote or assited in writting.
