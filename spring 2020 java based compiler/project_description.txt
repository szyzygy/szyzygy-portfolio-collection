In this project I worked in a 4 person team designing a compiler for basic C code. In this project we used Java and JavaCC , an extension that helps with compiler design, to build the compiler. I was responsible throughout for helping design the documentation and parsing for the compiler, as well as the back end of the compiler translate or intermediate representation of C into usable Assembly code.
